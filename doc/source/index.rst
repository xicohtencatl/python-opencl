Welcome to python-opencl's documentation!
=========================================

`OpenCL`_ is a standard for parallel programming on heterogeneous devices
including CPUs, GPUs, and others processors. It provides a common language
C-like language for executing code on those devices, as well as APIs to
setup the computations.
`python-opencl`_ aims at being an easy to use Python wrapper around the `OpenCL`_ library.
`python-opencl`_ is licensed under the `GPL`_ version 3 or later.

Do not hesitate to clone `python-opencl`_::

  git clone git://gitorious.org/python-opencl/python-opencl.git

`Homepage`_ | `Project`_ | `Download`_ | `Mailing List`_ | `F.A.Q.`_

A distributed bug tracker, `ticgit`_, is used to store tickets as a branch inside the
Git repository.
`python-opencl`_ has been tested both on GPUs and CPUs with the OpenCL libraries from
`NVIDIA`_ and from `AMD (ATI Stream)`_.
